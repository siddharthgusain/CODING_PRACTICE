1. CPP file is a simple text file containing bunch of characters in some syntax that could be
understood by compiler.
2. Source code -> preprocessor -> PURE HLL file
3. PURE HLL file -> Compiler -> Assembly file
4. Assembly file -> Assembler -> Object file/Machine code
5. Different Object file -> Linker -> Fully linked /partially linked Object/executable file.

NOTE:- The program we will bw writing will be synchronous single threaded programs(they could be multifile)

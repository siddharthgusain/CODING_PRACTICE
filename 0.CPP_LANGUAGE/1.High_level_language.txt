1. C++ is a high level language 
2. It gets compiled + assembled into machine code(instruction set of machine architecture)

Why write code in high level when u can write same code in assembly or machine code(actual 0 and 1)
1. Reducing Time to build application.
2. Scalability and maintainability and debugging of software over long period.
3. New developers is more familiar with HLL.
4. Using compiler and assembler softwares to automate the task of generating machine code on behalf of Us.
5. Last 40 years , compiler and assembler softwares have gone significant improvement.
6. No need for a developer to understand the machine instruction set , only understand syntax of a language.
7. Porting to different CPU architecture without writing source code again, just writing compiler for that architecture.
8. Write once , use everywhere principle.

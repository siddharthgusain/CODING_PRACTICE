1. Two d array is nothing just a linear array in memory but as an programmer we can consider it as
a 2-d matrix and visualize it in 2-d form.
2. Array name is just a pointer to its first element
3. Random access is possible by basic mathematic calculations
4. Logical view of 2-d array is like rows and columns or a table, but physically they are coninous blocks of memory 
and size depends on data type 
5. In 2d array "column" specification is mandatory as rows can be caluclated by (total elements/number of columns).
6. Random access is possible because any element address can be calculated with simple maths as blocks are contigous
and their size is fixed.

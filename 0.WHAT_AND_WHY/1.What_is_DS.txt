-> Each program consists of only two things :- data and instructions to work on that data.
-> The way in which data is stored in memory(RAM) largely determines how slow and fast our
program will run , as to fetch data from RAM cpu cycles are required , if data is organised
in a way that it can be accessed with fewer cpu cyles.
-> Second thing to optimise is steps to access the data (algorithms).

->The way we store a DATA in RAM is "Data" "structure".
-> The steps to manipulate data efficiently with less complexity hence less cpu cycles is 
alogorithms.

-> Data can be store only in two ways physically in RAM:-
1. Contigously (Array)
2. Non-contigously (linkedlist)

->Other Data structures are combination or extenstion of these two way of storing data.
-> Here we generally deals with optimising RAM usage.

-> Inside operating system a large number of data structures are used like linked list , arrays ,
trees etc;

-> Process control blocks(PCB) are also stored in linked list.

-> Recursion is very much linked to functions and call stack
-> Recursion means function calling another function , this another function could be itself or some other function

Two types of recursion:-
1. Direct Recursion :- Function calling itself
2. Indirect Recursion:- Function calling another function and another function calling former one and so on.

Types of recursion according to where recusive call is made:-
1. Head recursion :- recursion at the starting of recursive function
2. Tail recursion :- recursion at the end of recursive function


-> Crux of recursion is we know solution to small problem using that we can solve bigger problem of same type
-> Its similar to Principle of mathematical induction

-> We have discuessed about following Data structure till now:-
1. Array(static)-> 1D , Multidimentional
2. Vector(dynamic array)
3. Strings

We will talks about another two data structures with are also linear and contigous:-
1. Stack 
2. Queue

Stack:- It can grow , but insertion , deletion takes place only in end/top 
-> Also we can only get top/end of Stack
-> It is more strict in comparision to array

Enough of theory , To implement stack we can use:-
1. Arrays
2. Pointer(Linked List)


// We have STL libary which provides the implementation already

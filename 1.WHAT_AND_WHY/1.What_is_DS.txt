-> Each program consists of only two things :- data and instructions to work on that data.
-> The way in which data is stored in memory(RAM) largely determines how slow and fast our
program will run , as to fetch data from RAM cpu cycles are required , if data is organized
in a way that it can be accessed with fewer cpu cycles.
-> Second thing to optimize is steps to access the data (Algorithms).

->The way we store a DATA in RAM is "Data" "structure".(Either Contiguously or Non Contiguously)
-> The steps to manipulate data efficiently with less complexity hence less cpu cycles is 
Algorithms.

-> Each Cpu instruction(Instruction set architecture) goes through multiple stages :-
Fetch -> decode -> Effective address -> execute.
-> Each of these stages takes multiple cpu clock cycles depending on type of instruction.
-> In algorithm analysis we don't really talk about hardware instruction set.

-> Data can be store only in two ways physically in RAM:-
1. Contiguously (Array)
2. Non-Contiguously (With pointers)

-> Other Data structures are combination or extension of these two way of storing data.
-> Here we generally deals with optimizing RAM usage.

-> Inside operating system a large number of data structures are used like linked list , arrays ,
trees etc;

-> Analyzing algorithm independent of platform or hardware is also known as "Asymptotic analysis"
-> Asymptotic analysis gives complexity of algorithm in terms of size of input .
-> Generally we calculate time and space complexity of a program in terms of input size

-> functions are very basic and fundamental programming construct
-> Functions make the large program to be divided into small routines.
-> each Routine/functions can have some functionality 
-> Functions are similar to math function that takes an input and gives output after processing Inside
its body.
-> TO make a large codebase maintainable and debuaggable functions are usefull.
-> We have already studied the inner working of stack and function calls.

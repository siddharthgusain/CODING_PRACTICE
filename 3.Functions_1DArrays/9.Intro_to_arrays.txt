-> Data types :- They tell what type of data a variable is storing .
Data types are just way of identifying in high level language , useful for compiler
In memory every variable is just a space in memory , according to data type its size is alloted.
-> Data types are used by compiler to convert source code into assembly with same size of data signified by
data type .

Data types are more considerable for strongly typed languages like c/c++ , java , not for weakly typed
 languages like javascript , python etc.

Types :- 
1. Predefined in language :- int , float etc
2. Derived :- arrays 
3. User defined :- class , structure , union , enum , typedef

-> We can store data in memory in two ways only :-
1. Continuously :- Arrays 
2. Non continuously :- Linked nodes with Pointers

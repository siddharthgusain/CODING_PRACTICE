Three things :-
1. Logic and pattern recognise(naive to optimised approach)
2. Clean code and fast code
3. Fast Debugging
4. Relate to real life problem
5. Reward based learning
6. Revise Periodically

All the problems can be broadly divided into two categories:-
1. Math pattern or formula problem, that can be solved in less complexity with formula(common for CP problems)
2. Logic problem , requires genrating algorithm for the problem.

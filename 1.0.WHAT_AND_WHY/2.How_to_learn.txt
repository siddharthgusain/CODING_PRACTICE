Things to keep in mind:-
1. Logic and pattern recognie(naive to optimised approach)
2. Clean code and fast code(variable name , functions use and proper indentation)
3. Fast Debugging
4. Relate to real life problem
5. Reward based learning
6. Revise Periodically

All the problems can be broadly divided into two categories:-
1. Math pattern or formula problem, that can be solved in less complexity with formula(common for CP problems)
2. Logic problem , requires generating algorithm with some data structure for the problem.

How to solve:-
1. Take small input 
2. Recognize pattern , solve for small input 
3. Generalize the pattern with algorithm , optimize with DS
4. Handle edge cases
